. I have found some problems in the code:
. Problems in the code:

1. useState missing an initial value

- useState() should have an initial value â€” I think it should be null or an empty object.

2. Missing useState import.

- code is missing useState import

3. map() missing a key prop

- React requires a key for list items to that we can track them efficiently.

4. Storing user.id instead of the user object

- Later try to display selectedUser.name, but the code only saved the id. This will cause an error. we should store the full user object.
