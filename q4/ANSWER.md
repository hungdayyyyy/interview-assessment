. I have found some problems in the code:
. Problems in the code:

1. Missing imports for hooks

- useState and useEffect are used but not imported.

2. Loading state initialisation order

- loading is set to true initially (good), but setLoading(false) is only called on success.
- If the fetch fails, loading will stay true forever.
- Suggestion: add .catch() to handle errors and set loading(false).

3. Error handling

- No error handling in the fetch request.
- Suggestion: store error in state and display an error message.

4. Filtering logic case sensitivity

- The .toLowerCase() I think it is fine, but the code is calling filter.toLowerCase() without proetecting if filter might be null/undefined. Since filter starts as '', it’s safe here, but in general be defensive.

5. Repeated .toLowerCase() calls

- You call .toLowerCase() on every render for every product.
- If performance matters, compute a lowercase filter string once before .filter().

6. Missing key prop in .map()

- In filteredProducts.map((product) => ...), each rendered <div> should have a unique key (usually product.id).

7. Inline styles

- The styles for <div> and <img> are inline. It’s better to move them to a CSS file or use a CSS-in-JS approach for maintainability.

8. Empty dependency array in useEffect

- The useEffect correctly has [] so it only runs on mount. But if API URL changes, we need to add it to dependencies.

9. API call is made directly inside the component

- I think this makes it harder to reuse the same API logic in other components and maintain the code when the endpoint changes
- Recommendation:
  . Move API calls into a separate services folder (e.g., services/productService.js) and export functions like getProducts().
  . Keep routing/endpoint constants in a constants or apiRoutes.js file.
  . The component should just call the service function and handle the returned data.
